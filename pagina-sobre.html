          analyses, ensuring a high <br />nutritional potential, flavor and practicality.<br />Each of our products

        <div class="lahza-is-a-comp-chnology-we-dev-Y7Wvca segoeui-regular-normal-white-42px">
          Lahza is a company in the food industry, founded in 2018. Our brand and <br />products are in line with global
          socioeconomic trends. We believe that this is <br />the time for changes in the preparation and consumption of
          processed foods. <br />Through technology, we develop products of excellent quality, with 99.6% <br />organic
          fruit powders with original flavor, aroma and texture. We use the <br />formulation with a unique and
          innovative blend for smoothies and whey, with <br />an amount of pure isolated protein (26g), per serving
          above the average of <br />the main competitors. The packages guarantee the best conservation, in
          <br />addition to having instructions for the preparation of the product. The <br />company works with the
          best logistics, in search of practicality and ease <br />in transport and handling, in order to guarantee a
          fair price for the customer.

        <div class="the-search-for-oraroma-texture-Y7Wvca segoeui-regular-normal-white-42px">
          The search for fruit consumption is on the rise in the world, as well as the <br />demand for time. With this
          in mind and in bringing to the customer a product <br />of the highest quality at an affordable price, we
          carry out several tests of flavor,<br />aroma, texture and nutritional power. Açaí Powder is the realization
          of that <br />dream. By introducing the freeze-drying technology, we innovated in the <br />Brazilian way with
          the production of Açaí Powder. The products ensure satiety <br />and practicality in preparation, have up to
          90% more fruit, when compared to <br />frozen pulp.<br />The audit of the production stages will soon be made
          available, carried out <br />through the BRCGS (Brand Reputation through Compliance). This assessment<br />ensures
          high safety accuracy in food handling, as it was created to certify the <br />supplier&#39;s compliance. In
          addition to ensuring the capacity of distributors to <br />guarantee the quality and safety of the food
          products they sell.<br />The product distribution process is audited by Smeta (Sedex Members&#39;
          <br />Business Ethics Audit), the most used in the world. Through Sedex&#39;s social <br />audit methodology,
          companies can assess their locations and suppliers to <br />understand the working conditions in their supply
          chain, ensuring supply and <br />easy access to products. Therefore, Lahza products are FDA (Food and Drug
          <br />Administration) certified, and we are looking for the JAS (Japan Agricultural <br />Standard) seal.
